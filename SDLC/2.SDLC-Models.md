## Common Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models

---

### 1. Waterfall Model

A step-by-step linear approach.

**Phases:**  
Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

**Best for:**  
Small projects with fixed requirements

**Pros:**

- Easy to manage
- Clear documentation

**Cons:**

- No flexibility
- Errors found late

---

### 2. V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)

An extension of the Waterfall model where testing is planned alongside development.

Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.

**Best for:**  
Safety-critical systems (medical, banking, defense)

---

### 3. Agile Model

Work is divided into small cycles called **sprints** (1–4 weeks).

**Best for:**  
Dynamic and changing requirements (startups, web applications)

**Key ideas:**

- Customer feedback
- Continuous delivery
- Team collaboration

**Examples:** Scrum, Kanban

---

### 4. Iterative Model

Software is built in repeated cycles.

Each version improves based on feedback.

**Best for:**  
Large projects where requirements are not fully clear

---

### 5. Spiral Model

Combines planning, prototyping, and risk analysis.

Used when the project is complex and high-risk.

**Best for:**  
Large enterprise systems

---

### 6. Big Bang Model

No formal planning — just code and build.

**Best for:**  
Small experimental projects

**Note:**  
Risky for real-world business applications

---

### 7. Prototype Model

A working model is built first to understand requirements.

**Best for:**  
Applications where users are unsure of what they want

---

### 8. DevOps Model

Focuses on continuous integration, testing, and deployment.

**Used by:**  
Modern software companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google
