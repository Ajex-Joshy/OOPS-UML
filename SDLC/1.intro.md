### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- It is a well structured process that guide software development project from start to end

#### The 7 phases of the software development life cycle

**1. Planning**

- project goals, objectives, requirements are gathered and documented

**2. Feasibility Analysis**

- technical requirements, estimating costs, risk analysis
- Risk assessment is essential to identifying potential challenges and determining if the project is worth pursuing.

**3. System Design**

- software's architecture and design
- creates a blueprint outlining how the software will function.
- includes high-level architecture and detailed design specifications to ensure software is user friendly

**4. Development**

- transforms the design into a functional application.
- write code on the designed specification following best practices & coding standards which results in efficient, secure, scalable and maintainable code.

**5. Testing (performance and security)**

- generates essential performance and usability feedback while revealing defects and quirks.
- different types of tests are performed
  - unit test
  - integration test
  - end to end test
  - security testing
- This is to identify and fix bugs before production

**6. Deployment**

- Once all the test are completed, the software can be deployed to end users.

**7. Maintenance**

- After software is deployed ongoing support is neccessary to

  - address issues
  - apply updates
  - add new features

- Continuous maintenance ensures that the software remains functional and relevant over time
