# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**.  
An object represents a real-world entity that contains both **data** and **behavior**.

Unlike procedural programming which focuses on functions, OOP focuses on **things (objects)**.

---

## Core Idea

In OOP:

- Programs are built using **objects**
- Objects are created from **classes**
- Each object stores its own data
- Objects interact by calling each other’s methods

The focus is on **modeling the real world**.

---

## The Same Example Problem

We will use the same **Bank Account System** to understand OOP.

The system should:

- Create an account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Show balance

---

## How OOP Thinks About This Problem

In OOP, we do not think about steps first.  
We think about **entities**.

Here, the main entity is:

- **Account**

An Account has:

- accountNumber
- name
- balance

And it can:

- deposit()
- withdraw()
- showBalance()

So we create a **class** called `Account`.

---

## Conceptual Structure

- Class: Account

  - Properties: accountNumber, name, balance
  - Methods: deposit(), withdraw(), showBalance()

- Objects:
  - AjexAccount
  - RahulAccount
  - etc.

Each object has its **own data** and **own behavior**.

---

## JavaScript OOP Version of Bank Account

```javascript
class Account {
  constructor(accountNumber, name, balance) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.name = name;
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= this.balance) {
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient balance");
    }
  }

  showBalance() {
    console.log(this.name, "Balance:", this.balance);
  }
}

// Creating objects
let ajexAccount = new Account(101, "Ajex", 5000);
let rahulAccount = new Account(102, "Rahul", 3000);

// Using objects
ajexAccount.deposit(2000);
ajexAccount.withdraw(1000);
ajexAccount.showBalance();

rahulAccount.deposit(500);
rahulAccount.showBalance();
```

## How This Is Different from Procedural

| Procedural             | OOP                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Data is separate       | Data is inside objects        |
| Functions work on data | Methods belong to objects     |
| One global state       | Each object has its own state |
| Hard to scale          | Easy to manage large systems  |

## Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation

Data and methods are wrapped inside a class.  
Only allowed operations can access the data.

### 2. Abstraction

We show only what is necessary and hide internal details.

### 3. Inheritance

One class can inherit properties and methods from another class.

### 4. Polymorphism

The same method can behave differently in different objects.

## Why OOP Is Powerful

OOP makes software:

- Easy to understand
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to expand
- Safe and secure

It is the foundation of:

- Java
- C++
- C#
- Python
- JavaScript frameworks

---

## Relation to UML

UML diagrams are used to:

- Design classes
- Show relationships
- Visualize OOP systems before coding

OOP + UML = Professional software design
