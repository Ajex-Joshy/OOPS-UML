# Procedural Programming Paradigm

Procedural programming is one of the earliest and most widely used programming paradigms.  
It is based on the idea of writing a program as a sequence of **instructions and procedures (functions)** that operate on data.

The program flows step‑by‑step, just like a recipe.

---

## Core Idea

In procedural programming:

- The program is divided into **functions**
- Each function performs a **specific task**
- Data is passed between functions
- The main program controls the execution flow

Focus is on **what to do first, second, third…**

---

## Characteristics

- Program is organized into functions
- Uses global or shared data
- Execution follows a top‑down approach
- Emphasis on **logic and flow**
- Easy to understand for small programs

---

## Common Languages

- C
- Pascal
- BASIC
- Early versions of C++

---

## The Example Problem (Used in All Paradigms)

We will use the **same problem** for all paradigms so that we can compare them easily.

### Problem:

A simple **Bank Account System**

The system should:

- Create an account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Show balance

---

## How Procedural Programming Solves This Problem

In procedural programming, we think in terms of **steps** and **functions**.

We do not think about objects like “Account”.  
We think about **actions** like:

- createAccount()
- deposit()
- withdraw()
- showBalance()

All data (account number, name, balance) is stored in variables and passed to functions.

---

## Program Structure (Conceptual)

The program looks like this:

- Variables

  - accountNumber
  - name
  - balance

- Functions

  - createAccount()
  - deposit()
  - withdraw()
  - showBalance()

- Main Program
  - Calls the above functions in a sequence

---

## Flow of Execution

1. Program starts
2. Account is created
3. User deposits money
4. User withdraws money
5. Balance is displayed
6. Program ends

The main function controls everything.

---

## Advantages

- Simple and easy to understand
- Fast execution
- Good for small applications
- Uses less memory

---

## Limitations

- Difficult to manage large programs
- Data is not protected (no security)
- Code reuse is limited
- Changes in one part can break other parts

---

## Why Procedural Programming Still Matters

Procedural programming is still used in:

- Embedded systems
- Low‑level programming
- High‑performance code
- System programming

It is the foundation on which other paradigms like OOP are built.

---

## Connection to Other Paradigms

Procedural programming focuses on **functions and steps**.  
OOP focuses on **objects and data**.  
Functional programming focuses on **functions and immutability**.

Understanding procedural programming helps you understand all other paradigms better.

```js
// Data (global variables)
let accountNumber = 101;
let name = "Ajex";
let balance = 5000;

// Functions (procedures)
function createAccount(accNo, accName, initialBalance) {
  accountNumber = accNo;
  name = accName;
  balance = initialBalance;
}

function deposit(amount) {
  balance = balance + amount;
}

function withdraw(amount) {
  if (amount <= balance) {
    balance = balance - amount;
  } else {
    console.log("Insufficient balance");
  }
}

function showBalance() {
  console.log("Account Holder:", name);
  console.log("Balance:", balance);
}

// Main program (execution flow)
createAccount(101, "Ajex", 5000);
deposit(2000);
withdraw(1000);
showBalance();
```
