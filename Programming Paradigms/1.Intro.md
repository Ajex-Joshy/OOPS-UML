### Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or ways of structuring and conceptualizing computer programs. They define how problems are approached, how solutions are designed, and how code is organized.

## 1. What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks and solve problems. As software grew more complex, developers needed better ways to organize and manage code. This led to the creation of different programming styles called **paradigms**.

## 2. What are Programming Paradigms?

A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring a program.  
It is not a programming language, but a **methodology for writing code**.

Programming languages like Java, C++, and Python support one or more paradigms.

Paradigms influence:

- How code is written
- How data is stored
- How programs are structured
- How easy it is to maintain and scale software

---

## 3. Why Do We Need Programming Paradigms?

As programs became larger and more complex, problems such as code duplication, bugs, and maintenance difficulty increased. Without a proper structure, software becomes chaotic and hard to manage.

Programming paradigms provide:

- Better organization of code
- Easier debugging
- Reusability of components
- Improved teamwork
- Scalability for large applications

## 4. Types of Programming Paradigms

Some of the major programming paradigms are:

- **Procedural Programming** – Programs are written as a sequence of steps or procedures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Programs are built using objects and classes.
- **Functional Programming** – Programs are built using functions and immutability.
- **Declarative Programming** – Describes what the program should achieve, not how.
- **Event-Driven Programming** – Program flow is determined by events like user actions.

---

## 5. Imperative vs Declarative Programming

Programming paradigms can be broadly classified into two categories:

- **Imperative** – Tells the computer how to do something step by step.  
  Example: Java, C, C++

- **Declarative** – Tells the computer what result is needed, not how to get it.  
  Example: SQL, HTML

## 6. Where Does Object-Oriented Programming Fit?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most widely used paradigms.  
It models software based on real-world objects.

OOP uses:

- Objects
- Classes
- Relationships between objects

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is used to visualize and design OOP-based systems.

## 7. Paradigms in Real-World Software

Modern software does not rely on just one paradigm.  
A single project may use multiple paradigms:

- Backend systems often use OOP
- User interfaces are event-driven
- Databases use declarative languages like SQL
- APIs may use functional programming concepts

---

## 8. Why OOP Became Dominant

OOP became popular because it helps in building large, complex systems by:

- Making code reusable
- Improving maintainability
- Supporting teamwork
- Modeling real-world problems naturally
