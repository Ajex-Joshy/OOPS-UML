# Declarative Programming Paradigm

Declarative programming is a paradigm where we describe **what we want**, not **how to achieve it**.  
The system decides the steps required to produce the result.

Instead of writing algorithms, we write **rules, queries, or descriptions**.

## Core Idea

In declarative programming:

- We specify the desired outcome
- We do not control the execution flow
- The system figures out the steps
- Code looks more like **statements** than procedures

The focus is on **results**, not **process**.

---

## The Same Example Problem

We use the same **Bank Account System**.

The system should:

- Store accounts
- Allow deposits
- Allow withdrawals
- Show balances

---

## How Declarative Programming Thinks About This Problem

In declarative programming, we do not write code like:

- first do this
- then do that

Instead, we define:

- What data exists
- What operations are allowed
- What result we want

The system (database or engine) figures out how to do it.

## Using SQL as a Declarative Example

Imagine all bank accounts are stored in a database table:

### Table: Accounts

| accountNumber | name  | balance |
| ------------- | ----- | ------- |
| 101           | Ajex  | 5000    |
| 102           | Rahul | 3000    |

---

## Declarative Operations

### Deposit Money

We do not say how to update row by row.  
We simply declare what should happen:

```sql
UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance + 2000
WHERE accountNumber = 101;
```

---

### Withdraw Money

```sql
UPDATE Accounts
SET balance = balance - 1000
WHERE accountNumber = 101 AND balance >= 1000;
```

---

### Show Balance

```sql
SELECT name, balance
FROM Accounts
WHERE accountNumber = 101;
```

---

## Why This Is Declarative

We never write:

- loops
- conditions
- memory operations

We only say:

> “Give me this result”

The database engine decides how to fetch and update the data.

## Declarative vs Procedural vs Functional

| Paradigm    | How it thinks                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Procedural  | Step by step instructions     |
| Functional  | Transform data with functions |
| Declarative | Describe the result           |

---

## Where Declarative Programming Is Used

Declarative programming is widely used in:

- SQL (Databases)
- HTML (UI description)
- CSS (Styling)
- Prolog
- Configuration files
- Cloud infrastructure (Terraform, Kubernetes)

---

## Why Declarative Programming Is Powerful

Declarative programming:

- Reduces code complexity
- Avoids bugs related to flow
- Is easy to read
- Is highly optimized by engines

It lets developers focus on **what they want**, not **how to do it**.

## Relation to Other Paradigms

Procedural → tells the computer how to do  
OOP → models real-world objects  
Functional → transforms data  
Declarative → describes the result

Together, they form the foundation of modern software systems.
