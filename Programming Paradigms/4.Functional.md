# Functional Programming Paradigm

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where computation is treated as the evaluation of **mathematical functions**.  
It avoids changing state and mutable data.

Instead of telling the computer **how** to do things, we tell it **what** to compute.

## Core Idea

In functional programming:

- Programs are built using **functions**
- Functions do not modify data
- Same input always gives the same output
- Data is treated as **immutable**

The focus is on **expressions and transformations**.

---

## The Same Example Problem

We will use the same **Bank Account System**.

The system should:

- Create an account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Show balance

---

## How Functional Programming Thinks About This Problem

In functional programming, we do not change the balance directly.  
Instead, we create **new versions** of data.

We treat an account as **data**, and functions return **new updated accounts**.

---

## JavaScript Functional Version of Bank Account

```javascript
// Account is just data
const createAccount = (accountNumber, name, balance) => ({
  accountNumber,
  name,
  balance,
});

// Functions do not change original account
const deposit = (account, amount) => ({
  ...account,
  balance: account.balance + amount,
});

const withdraw = (account, amount) => {
  if (amount > account.balance) {
    console.log("Insufficient balance");
    return account;
  }
  return {
    ...account,
    balance: account.balance - amount,
  };
};

const showBalance = (account) => {
  console.log(account.name, "Balance:", account.balance);
};

// Using functions
let ajexAccount = createAccount(101, "Ajex", 5000);
ajexAccount = deposit(ajexAccount, 2000);
ajexAccount = withdraw(ajexAccount, 1000);
showBalance(ajexAccount);
```

## How Functional Programming Is Different

In this model:

- No variable is modified
- Every operation returns a **new account**
- Data is never mutated
- Functions are pure

This makes programs predictable and safe.

## Procedural vs Functional Programming

| Procedural                 | Functional                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Data is changed directly   | Data is never modified      |
| Uses global variables      | Uses immutable data         |
| Step-by-step execution     | Expression-based            |
| Functions can change state | Functions return new values |
| Hard to debug              | Easy to test and debug      |

---

## Why Functional Programming Is Powerful

Functional programming:

- Prevents unexpected bugs
- Is easier to test
- Works well with parallel systems
- Is great for modern applications

It is used in:

- React
- Node.js
- Big data processing
- Cloud systems

---

## When to Use Functional Programming

Functional programming is best when:

- Data must be reliable
- Systems are highly concurrent
- You need predictable behavior
- You work with transformations and pipelines

---

## Relation to Other Paradigms

Procedural focuses on **steps**  
OOP focuses on **objects**  
Functional focuses on **transformations**

Understanding all three gives you the full picture of software design.
