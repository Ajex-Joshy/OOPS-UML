# Event-Driven Programming Paradigm

Event-Driven Programming is a paradigm where the flow of a program is controlled by **events**.  
An event can be a user action, a message, a timer, or any signal that something has happened.

Instead of running in a fixed sequence, the program **waits for events and reacts to them**.

---

## Core Idea

In event-driven programming:

- The program stays idle
- It waits for events
- When an event happens, a function (handler) runs
- The system is always reacting

The focus is on **responses**, not steps.

---

## The Same Example Problem

We use the same **Bank Account System**.

The system should:

- Create an account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Show balance

But now, actions happen **when the user clicks buttons or sends requests**.

---

## How Event-Driven Programming Thinks

We do not write:

- First create
- Then deposit
- Then withdraw

We write:

- When user clicks Deposit → run deposit logic
- When user clicks Withdraw → run withdraw logic
- When user asks for balance → show it

The system is driven by **events**.

## JavaScript Event-Driven Example

Imagine a simple web or Node.js system:

```javascript
let account = {
  accountNumber: 101,
  name: "Ajex",
  balance: 5000,
};

function deposit(amount) {
  account.balance += amount;
  console.log("Deposited:", amount);
}

function withdraw(amount) {
  if (amount <= account.balance) {
    account.balance -= amount;
    console.log("Withdrawn:", amount);
  } else {
    console.log("Insufficient balance");
  }
}

function showBalance() {
  console.log(account.name, "Balance:", account.balance);
}

// Events
document.getElementById("depositBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  deposit(2000);
});

document.getElementById("withdrawBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  withdraw(1000);
});

document.getElementById("balanceBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  showBalance();
});
```

## How This Works

1. The program loads
2. It waits for button clicks
3. Each click triggers a function
4. The system reacts to user actions

There is no fixed execution order.

## Event-Driven vs Other Paradigms

| Paradigm     | How it runs            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Procedural   | Runs step by step      |
| OOP          | Objects call methods   |
| Functional   | Data is transformed    |
| Declarative  | Result is described    |
| Event-Driven | Events trigger actions |

## Where Event-Driven Programming Is Used

Event-driven programming is everywhere:

- Web applications (clicks, forms)
- Mobile apps
- Node.js servers
- Games
- GUI applications
- Real-time systems

---

## Why Event-Driven Programming Is Powerful

Event-driven systems:

- Are interactive
- Are responsive
- Scale well
- Work perfectly for modern apps

It is the backbone of:

- React
- Angular
- Node.js
- Android & iOS apps

---

## Final Understanding

Event-driven programming models **real life**:
We don’t act in a sequence — we **react** to things that happen.

That’s why modern software is built using this paradigm.
