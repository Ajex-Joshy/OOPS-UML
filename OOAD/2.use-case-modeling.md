# Use Case Modeling (OOAD)

Use Case Modeling is the process of identifying **who** uses the system and **what** they can do with it.  
It captures the **functional requirements** of a system from the user’s point of view.

It answers two key questions:

- Who are the users?
- What do they want to achieve?

---

## Why Use Case Modeling is Important

Before designing classes or writing code, we must understand:

- What problem the system is solving
- What actions users perform
- What the system must support

Use cases prevent:

- Missing features
- Wrong assumptions
- Building the wrong system

---

## Key Terms

### Actor

An **actor** is any external entity that interacts with the system.
It can be:

- A person (Customer, Admin)
- Another system (Payment Gateway)
- A device (ATM)

### Use Case

A **use case** is a specific action that an actor can perform with the system.

Examples:

- Withdraw Money
- Transfer Funds
- View Balance

---

## System Boundary

The system boundary defines:

- What is inside the system
- What is outside the system

Everything inside the boundary is built by us.  
Everything outside is an actor.

---

## Our Example System

We will continue using the **Bank Account System**.

Actors:

- Customer
- Bank Admin
- ATM
- Payment Gateway

---

## Identifying Use Cases

From the user’s point of view:

### Customer can:

- Open account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check balance
- Transfer money

### Bank Admin can:

- Approve account
- Close account
- View all accounts

### ATM can:

- Send withdrawal request
- Send balance request

## Use Case List

| Actor    | Use Case           |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Customer | Open Account       |
| Customer | Deposit Money      |
| Customer | Withdraw Money     |
| Customer | Check Balance      |
| Customer | Transfer Money     |
| Admin    | Approve Account    |
| Admin    | Close Account      |
| ATM      | Request Withdrawal |
| ATM      | Request Balance    |

## Why Use Cases Come Before Classes

We first decide:

- What the system should do

Then later:

- How it should be built

This ensures our design is driven by **user needs**, not by code.

---

## Final Understanding

Use Case Modeling ensures that:

- The system solves the right problem
- All user actions are covered
- The design is user-focused

It is the first and most important step in Object-Oriented Analysis.
