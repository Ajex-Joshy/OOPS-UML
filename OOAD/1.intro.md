# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)

OOAD is the discipline of analyzing real-world problems and designing software solutions using object-oriented concepts before writing any code.

It helps transform business requirements into a clear technical blueprint.

## Why OOAD Exists

Large software systems fail not because of coding, but because of poor design. OOAD ensures:

- Correct understanding of the problem
- Proper identification of objects
- Clean architecture
- Easy maintenance and scalability

---

## Two Phases of OOAD

### Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

Understanding the problem:

- Who are the users?
- What actions do they perform?
- What real-world entities exist?

### Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

Designing the solution:

- What classes should exist?
- What are their responsibilities?
- How do they interact?

OOA = Understand the problem
OOD = Design the solution

## Role of UML

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is used to visualize OOAD decisions. It helps draw:

- Use case diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams

---

## OOAD in Real Projects

Every professional software project follows this flow:

Problem → OOAD → UML → OOPS → Code

---

## Example: Bank Account System

Before coding, OOAD helps identify:

- Account
- Customer
- Transaction
- ATM

And their interactions.

## Why OOAD Makes You a Better Engineer

OOAD allows you to:

- Build scalable systems
- Avoid bad architecture
- Think like a software architect

It is the foundation of professional software development.
