# Design Principles (OOAD)

Design Principles are rules that guide how we structure classes and relationships so that systems are:

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to extend
- Hard to break

They ensure that our OOAD turns into clean, professional software.

---

## Why Design Principles Matter

Bad design:

- Breaks when features are added
- Is hard to test
- Creates bugs

Good design:

- Is flexible
- Is reusable
- Grows with the system

---

## The SOLID Principles

SOLID is the foundation of object-oriented design.

---

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have **one and only one reason to change**.

Example:

- Account should manage money
- Transaction should record transactions

Do not mix UI, logging, and business logic in one class.

---

## 2. Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes should be:

- Open for extension
- Closed for modification

Example:

- You can add a new account type without changing the Account class

We use inheritance and interfaces to achieve this.

---

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

A child class should be usable wherever the parent class is expected.

Example:

- SavingsAccount should work wherever Account is used

If it breaks behavior, the design is wrong.

---

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Example:

- ATM should not be forced to support admin operations

Create small, focused interfaces.

---

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level classes should not depend on low-level classes.  
Both should depend on abstractions.

Example:

- Account should depend on PaymentService, not on UPI or Card directly.

---

## Additional OOAD Principles

### High Cohesion

A class should do one thing well.

### Low Coupling

Classes should not be tightly connected.

### Encapsulation

Hide internal data and expose only necessary methods.

---

## How Design Principles Fit in OOAD

Use Cases → Domain Model → Class Design → Relationships → Design Principles → Code

Design principles make sure your design is **future-proof**.

---

## Final Understanding

OOAD without design principles is just diagrams.  
With design principles, it becomes **real software architecture**.
