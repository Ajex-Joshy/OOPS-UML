# Class Design (OOAD)

Class Design is the step where we convert **domain entities** into **software classes**.  
It defines how the system will be structured in code.

If Domain Model tells us **what exists**, Class Design tells us **how to build it in software**.

---

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint that defines:

- Data (attributes)
- Behavior (methods)

Objects are created from classes.

---

## From Domain Model to Classes

From the **Bank Account domain model**, we identified:

- Customer
- Account
- Transaction
- Bank
- ATM
- Admin

These now become **software classes**.

---

## Designing the Account Class

### Attributes

- accountNumber
- balance
- accountType
- status

### Methods

- deposit(amount)
- withdraw(amount)
- getBalance()
- closeAccount()

---

## Designing the Customer Class

### Attributes

- customerId
- name
- phone
- email

### Methods

- openAccount()
- viewAccounts()

---

## Designing the Transaction Class

### Attributes

- transactionId
- amount
- date
- type

### Methods

- execute()
- cancel()

---

## Designing the Bank Class

### Attributes

- bankName
- branchCode

### Methods

- addAccount()
- removeAccount()
- getAllAccounts()

---

## Designing the ATM Class

### Attributes

- atmId
- location

### Methods

- requestWithdrawal()
- requestBalance()

---

## Assigning Responsibilities

Good class design follows:

> Each class should have **one clear responsibility**

Examples:

- Account manages money
- Customer owns accounts
- Transaction records operations
- ATM acts as an interface

---

## Encapsulation in Class Design

Data should not be accessed directly.  
We expose data only through methods.

Example:

- balance should not be changed directly
- deposit() and withdraw() should control it

---

## High Cohesion and Low Coupling

Good design means:

- A class does one thing well (high cohesion)
- Classes are not tightly dependent on each other (low coupling)

This makes systems easy to change and test.

## Class Design vs Coding

| Class Design            | Coding            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Decide structure        | Write syntax      |
| Decide responsibilities | Implement logic   |
| UML level               | Programming level |

---

## How Class Design Fits in OOAD

Use Cases → Domain Model → Class Design → Code

Class design is the **final step before programming starts**.

---

## Final Understanding

Class Design turns:

> Real-world objects → Software blueprints

It ensures that when we start writing OOP code,  
we are building a **clean, scalable system**.
