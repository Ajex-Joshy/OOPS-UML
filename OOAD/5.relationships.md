# Relationships in OOAD

Relationships define how classes and objects are connected to each other.  
They describe how data and responsibilities flow between different parts of a system.

Without relationships, classes are just isolated blocks.

## Why Relationships Matter

Good relationships:

- Make systems realistic
- Improve code reuse
- Reduce duplication
- Enable scalability

Poor relationships create:

- Tight coupling
- Hard-to-change systems
- Bugs

---

## Main Types of Relationships

OOAD uses four major relationship types:

1. Association
2. Aggregation
3. Composition
4. Inheritance

---

## 1. Association

Association means a **general connection** between two classes.
Two things know about each other, but neither owns the other.

Example:

- Customer ↔ Account

A customer **has** an account.  
They are related, but both can exist independently.

---

## 2. Aggregation

One thing contains another, but the other can live alone.

Aggregation is a **weak whole–part relationship**.

Example:

- Bank has Accounts

If the bank is deleted, the accounts may still exist.

Bank ◇── Account

---

## 3. Composition

Composition is a **strong whole–part relationship**.
One thing fully owns another.
If the owner dies, the part dies.

Example:

- Account has Transactions

If the account is deleted, its transactions should also be deleted.

Account ◆── Transaction

---

## 4. Inheritance

Inheritance means:

> One class is a specialized version of another

Example:

- SavingsAccount is an Account
- CurrentAccount is an Account

SavingsAccount ──► Account

## Relationships in Our Bank System

| Relationship | Example                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Association  | Customer ↔ Account       |
| Aggregation  | Bank ◇ Account           |
| Composition  | Account ◆ Transaction    |
| Inheritance  | SavingsAccount → Account |

---

## Why We Use Different Relationships

Each relationship represents **real-world meaning**:

- Association → Connected
- Aggregation → Has
- Composition → Owns
- Inheritance → Is-a

Using the correct relationship makes UML and code accurate.

---

## How Relationships Affect Code

Relationships decide:

- Which class holds references
- Who creates whom
- Who destroys whom

They directly impact memory, security, and architecture.

---

## Final Understanding

Relationships are the **glue** of object-oriented systems.  
They turn separate classes into a **working system**.

Good OOAD depends more on relationships than on individual classes.
