# Domain Modeling (OOAD)

Domain Modeling is the process of identifying the **real‑world entities** involved in a system and how they relate to each other.  
It converts business language into **software concepts**.

If Use Cases answer **what users do**, Domain Models answer **what things exist**.

---

## What is a Domain?

A **domain** is the business area for which we are building software.

Examples:

- Banking
- E‑commerce
- Healthcare
- Education

Our domain here is **Banking**.

---

## What is a Domain Model?

A Domain Model is:

- A visual or conceptual representation of
- Real‑world entities
- Their attributes
- And their relationships

It does NOT contain code.  
It contains **meaning**.

---

## Why Domain Modeling is Important

Domain models:

- Prevent wrong class creation
- Avoid missing important entities
- Ensure the software matches real business
- Create a shared language between developers and stakeholders

---

## Our Example Domain: Bank Account System

From use cases, we identified these real‑world concepts:

- Customer
- Account
- Transaction
- Bank
- ATM
- Admin

These are called **domain entities**.

---

## Identifying Domain Entities

We ask:

> “What nouns appear in the problem?”

From the banking problem:

- Customer
- Account
- Balance
- Transaction
- ATM
- Bank
- Admin

These become **candidates for classes** later.

---

## Adding Attributes

Each domain entity has **data**.

### Customer

- customerId
- name
- phone
- email

### Account

- accountNumber
- balance
- accountType
- status

### Transaction

- transactionId
- amount
- date
- type (deposit, withdraw)

### ATM

- atmId
- location

---

## Relationships Between Entities

Now we ask:

> “How are these things connected?”

- A Customer **owns** an Account
- An Account **has many** Transactions
- An ATM **performs** Transactions
- A Bank **manages** Accounts

These relationships are the foundation of UML diagrams.

---

## Types of Relationships

- **Association** – general connection
- **One‑to‑many** – one account → many transactions
- **Many‑to‑one** – many accounts → one bank

We will map these later in UML class diagrams.

## Domain Model vs Class Model

| Domain Model        | Class Model      |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Business view       | Technical view   |
| Real‑world concepts | Software classes |
| No methods          | Has methods      |
| Used in analysis    | Used in design   |

## How Domain Model Fits in OOAD

Use Cases → Domain Model → Class Design → Code

The domain model ensures that:

> We build software that matches the real world.
